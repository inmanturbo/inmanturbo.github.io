> Various notes, guides and references on how I setup some of my labs and infrastructure. 

### Intro, or "Why the plural `Labs`"?

I'm not running a homelab like you will see on r/Homelab etc, though there's no reason why this knowledge base couldn't be applied to one. I'm experimenting with a wide range of solutions, each applied to its own distinct set of problems. I'm not actually using this stuff at home for anything like gaming or streaming, storing media, etc. 

The only permanent fixtures in the actual physical lab space is the network gear. An SDN capable switch and a pfsense firewall. The rest is a perpetual set of builds, rebuilds and other projects in a constant state of flux.

In short I use this stuff as a staging ground for work. Nothing is permanent because the requirements tend to change depending on what I'm working on. If I ever do decide to set up a distinct homelab for my own personal I may will make an entry below like `#### [Homelab](homelab`)

#### [TrueNAS](truenas)
#### [Ubuntu KVM Host](linux/kvm-host/ubuntu-22.04)
#### [PfSense](pfsense)
#### [Samba Domain Controller](samba-domain-controller)
