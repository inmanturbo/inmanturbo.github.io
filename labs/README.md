> Various notes, guides and references on how I setup some of my labs and infrastructure. 

### Intro, or "Why the plural `Labs`"?

I'm not running a homelab like you will see on r/Homelab etc, though there's no reason why this knowledge base couldn't be applied to one. I'm experimenting with a wide range of solutions, which I will attempt to apply to various real-world problems. I'm not actually using this stuff at home for anything like gaming or streaming, storing media, etc. 

Currently the only permanent fixtures in the actual physical lab space is the network gear. An SDN capable switch and a pfsense firewall. The rest is a perpetual set of builds, rebuilds and other projects in a constant state of flux.
